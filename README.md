### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
I built a webpage that successfully plays Tic-Tac-Toe with two players. The users can click on empty tiles to place their tokens. The turns alternate by player in each game. Additionally, each player will have a turn going first at the start of each game. There is a banner and the top of the screen that will inform users of each turn and each win. On each side, the players will have a counter that displays their respective wins. If there is a draw, the banner will display that it is a draw, the wins will stay the same and the player who started first, will go second. After every win, or draw, the game will reset itself after a short pause so everyone can see the banner display the result.


### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)
- Clone the SSH code from this [link](https://github.com/rae-107/tic-tac-toe) to your local computer
- Open in your text editor 
- Read the README.md 
- In the terminal, run the coommand open index.html for initial deployment and interaction with app

### Preview of App:
[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off.)

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
I am a mod 1 student and this is my final project. I have worked approximately 25 hours on this project, building code as well as checking for bugs.

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
- DRY JavaScript
- Event delegation to handle similar event listeners
- Understand the difference between the data model and how the data is displayed on the DOM
- Iterate through/filter DOM elements using for loops
- Use your problem solving process to break down large problems, solve things step by step, and trust yourself to not rely on an outside “answer” to a logical challenge

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
##### Wins
1. Biggest win is having this be a solo project and being proud of what I've written on my own.
2. Using parameters was a huge win too. I initially had two chunky blocks of code that I was able to skim down a lot with the use or parameters
3. Using the data model to play tic-tac-toe before writting functionality for the DOM was a win


##### Challenges
1. Using the data model to play tic-tac-toe before writting functionality for the DOM was also a huge challenge
2. Finding all the pesky bugs was a challenge. Especially when you think you're finished or it takes longer than you think it would to fix.
3. Writting dynamic functions. I had a good amount that I was able to rewrite to have less lines but ultimately it's still challenging to make code more dymanic.
